## 🌟 What is Explainor?

Explainor is an AI agent that takes any topic you want to learn about and explains it through the voice of fun characters! Choose from 6 unique personas:

| Persona | Style |
|---------|-------|
| 👶 **5-Year-Old** | Simple words, excited, curious questions |
| 👨‍🍳 **Gordon Ramsay** | Intense, food metaphors, "It's RAW!" |
| 🏴‍☠️ **Pirate** | "Arrr!", treasure metaphors, swashbuckling |
| 🎭 **Shakespeare** | Dramatic, old English, theatrical |
| 🏄 **Surfer Dude** | "Brooo", chill vibes, wave metaphors |
| 🧙 **Yoda** | Inverted syntax, wise, Force references |

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Enter a topic** - Anything from "Quantum Computing" to "How do volcanoes work?"
2. **Choose a persona** - Pick your favorite character
3. **Choose your audience** - Who are you explaining to?
4. **Watch the magic** - The AI agent:
   - 🔍 Researches your topic using web search
   - 📋 Extracts key facts from sources
   - 🎭 Transforms the explanation into the character's voice
   - 🔊 Reads it aloud with a matching voice!

## 👤 Who's Listening?

Make the explanation even more tailored by choosing your audience:

| Audience | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| 👤 Just me | Standard explanation |
| 👵 My confused grandmother | Extra simple, patient |
| 🤖 A skeptical robot | Logical, evidence-based |
| 👽 An alien visiting Earth | Explain Earth concepts |
